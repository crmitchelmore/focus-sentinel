/// The Privacy settings pane.
///
/// It says true things plainly and then proves them: this is where the data lives, here is the
/// button that shows you the file, here is what this Mac lets the app do and what it does
/// instead where it cannot. Nothing here is a promise about a future feature — deleting
/// everything is e07's surface and the full capability disclosure is e10's, and neither is
/// announced here.
///
/// **There is no call to action in the capability half, and that is the requirement rather than
/// a style choice.** F-126 asks the surface to show what is active, what is reduced and what the
/// reduced behaviour actually is, *with no call to action that would be an ask in disguise*. In
/// this epic the app could not ask even if somebody added a button: every prompting API is
/// banned from the shipping graph by lint (R-33).
///
/// The one limitation that is easy to hide is stated here instead: a person working over Screen
/// Sharing produces only synthetic input events, so the hardware idle source will consider them
/// away. That is a real consequence of choosing the more pessimistic of the two idle sources
/// (R-36), and the honest place for it is the pane about what the app can and cannot see.
